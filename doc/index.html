        <article><h1>Foo-Library</h1>

<pre><code>We hide the name of our library because we are participating a competition.
This library is a framework for creating multi-device games via WebSocket connection.</code></pre>

<h2>A Model of Games Developed under This Library</h2>

<h3>Devices</h3>

<pre><code>In the game, device are used as a &quot;station&quot; or a &quot;gamepad&quot;.
Station refers to a device with big screen and high performance, and runs the main scene of a game.
Gamepad refers to lightweight devices without high performance, and are used as controllers of a game.</code></pre>

<h3>Network</h3>

<pre><code>The game should run among a low-delay network, for examples, a computer and some cellphones connected to one wireless router, or some cellphones connected to a ad-hoc network created by a computer or pad.
So a station with ad-hoc support can run the game anywhere.
As for online games, because the Wi-Fi adapter is working in the ad-hoc network, is not easy to be taken anywhere.</code></pre>

<h3>Browser</h3>

<pre><code>Browsers must support HTML5 and WebSocket, also, WebGL support on the station can greatly improve the game experience.
Browsers on gamepads would better has rich device API support like device orientation, device motion, and vibrate feedback.
We suggest to use chrome browser on the station, and UCBrowser on the gamepad.</code></pre>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<pre><code>A WebSocket server should run on the station, and the foreground of the game can run on the browser of the station, and gamepads should connect to the WebSocket and do data exchanges with station.</code></pre>

<h3>Expected Effect</h3>

<pre><code>A high-performance station can run the main scene of a game, brings great graphics, and gamepads with device orientation, device motion, and vibrate feedback can become a gamepad no worse than a gamepad from PS3.
So we can achieve very good game experience.</code></pre>

<h2>Using This Library</h2>

<h3>Refer JSs and CSSs</h3>

<pre><code>On the station, you should refer to &quot;gamewatcher.js&quot;, and use the &quot;on&quot; function to register listeners to messages from gamepads.
On the gamepads, you should refer to &quot;gamepad.js&quot;, and so you can send data from device API or screen event to the station, also, we have encapsulate the device API, and automatically send data from device API.
And there we have encapsulated some basic controller components, for example sticks, sliders, and buttons, and you should refer to &quot;UIManager.js&quot; and &quot;components.css&quot;.</code></pre></article>
